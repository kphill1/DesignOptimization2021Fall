    "# Things to check during your analysis and optimization \n",
    "## What are your design variables, constraints, and objectives?\n",
    "My design variables are the disk's outer diamter and disk's thickness. I chose these as my variables because through doing research on brake disks, these factors were how different brakes were distinguished. I chose my constraint as the disk's inner diameter because during my research I found it was uncommon for the brake disk's inner diamter to be listed so I chose to just keep it the same as what was given in the example. My objectives are to minimize the brake disk's volume, minimize the max stress in the brake disk, maximize the first natural frequency of the brake disk, and minimize the maximum temperature the brake disk is subjected to. In terms of constraints, the resonant frequency for a BMW 5 Series Sedan is 34 Hz, so it is ideal that at a minimum the first natural frequency is above this (1). For a standard road car, the highest temperature their brake disks should be able to handle is 130 degress celsius (2). The final constraint is for the stress in the brake disk which is limited by the factor of safety. The typical factor of safety in an automobile is 3, so the max stress occuring on the brake disk cannot be greater than 1/3 of the maximum stress for the material that the disk is made out of (3). In order to make sure that the chance of failure is low, I am going to choose the max stress at the tensile ultimate stress because it is lower than the compressive one. The ultimate stress is 2.4e8 Pa so the max stress we can subject the brake pad to is 8e7 Pa.\n",
    "## What are the potential trade-offs between your objectives?\n",
    "The first natural frequency of the brake disk is inversely related to the maximum stress in the brake disk.\n",
    "When vol inc: stress inc, freq dec, and temp dec\n",
    "When vol dec: stress dec, freq inc, and temp inc\n",
    "When stress inc: unknown relation between stress and freq, and stress and temp\n",
    "None of the relationships are linear\n",
    "## Are your variables continuous? Or are they discrete/integer?\n",
    "My variables are continuous because they can assume any value in the range I give them. Looking at data with brake disk sizes, they can essentially assume any value within the ranges.\n",
    "## Do you have analytical objective/constraint functions? And are they differentiable?\n",
    "## Based on the above answers, what optimization methods will you choose?\n",
    "## Perform a sensitivity analysis and comment on the importance of your variables? Also, do you observe monotonicity (i.e., the objective always goes up or down with a variable)?\n",
    "## Compare your optimal design against the initial one (e.g., see the following comparison on the brake disc design) AND comment on whether the optimal design is reasonable.\n",
    "## Insert figure for single-objective vs multi-objetive such as pareto curve or pareto fronteir\n",
